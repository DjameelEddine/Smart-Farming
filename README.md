# Smart-Farming
This Data-Driven project aim to guide farmers allocating resources (e.g. Water Usage, Fertilizer Usage, Irrigation Frequency) for different crop types based on soil and environmental conditions by adopting search algorithms (e.g. A*, Genetic Algorithm, Constraint Satisfaction Problem, etc.) that consider a real-world collected dataset.
